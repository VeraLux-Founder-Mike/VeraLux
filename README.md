## 🎯 Why VeraLux Wins the Hackathon

### 💸 Game-Changing Tokenomics
- **Fixed Supply**: 1B LUX, no minting, ever.  
- **Deflationary Design**: 5% tax per transfer:  
  - 🔥 20% burned to boost scarcity  
  - 💧 24% to liquidity for stable trading  
  - 🌍 20% to charity, plus treasury, team, and LP incentives  
- **Anti-Whale**: governance voting caps, vesting schedules, transaction caps and progressive tax.
- **Early stability**: A robust suite of features, including emergency pauses, treasury management, transaction caps, progressive taxes, staking incentives, and multisig governance and more, all designed to prevent manipulation and foster a secure token ecosystem.


### 🌱 Staking That Empowers
Stake 20K–5M LUX across four tiers, earning 500–125K LUX weekly:  

| Tier | LUX Staked | Lock Period | Weekly Reward |
|------|------------|-------------|---------------|
| 🥉 T0 | 20K        | 7 days      | 500 LUX       |
| 🥈 T1 | 100K       | 14 days     | 2,500 LUX     |
| 🥇 T2 | 500K       | 30 days     | 12,500 LUX    |
| 💎 T3 | 5M         | 30 days     | 125,000 LUX   |

### 🗳️ Governance by the People
- **12+ Proposal Types**: Stakers vote on tax rates, staking tiers, and more.  
- **Voting Power**: Tier 1+ (≥100K LUX) get 1–20 votes, boosted up to 1.995x after 90 days.  
- **Secure Process**: 14-day voting, 3-day execution delay, multisig oversight.

### 🔒 Fortress-Level Security
- **Reentrancy Guard**: Blocks recursive attacks.  
- **Multisig Controls**: 2–5 signatures for critical actions.  
- **Timelocks**: 24h for pauses, 72h for whitelist changes.  
- **Audits**: Regular third-party checks ensure trust.

### 🚀 Future Vision: A Meta Protocol
VeraLux is laying the groundwork for its own blockchain, a **meta protocol for consumer infrastructure**:  
- **Ethical Marketplace**: Trade goods and NFTs without middlemen.  
- **Social Platform**: Earn LUX for positive engagement, free from censorship.  
- **MMORPG**: Play, earn, and connect in a decentralized game world.  
- **Vetted Ecosystem**: Businesses build on our chain, aligned with our values.

 Hackathon Journey
Solo founder Michael Williams kicked off VeraLux 6 weeks ago, inspired by global shifts toward decentralization. In just days, we’ve added a developer (testing our smart contract) and a community manager (crafting X campaigns). Our hustle:
Weeks 1-2: Built tokenomics (1B supply, 5% tax).  

Weeks 3-4: Added staking tiers and governance.  

Week 5: Secured with reentrancy guards, timelocks.  

Week 6: Devnet deployment, community buzz on X.
